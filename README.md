# ELIO - Intelligent Medical Notes

Landing page and project overview for ELIO — a Portfolio Project developed at Holberton School.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Demo: embedded YouTube demo video.
- Final CTA: button to deployed application.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a polished `landingpage.html` (I already included a ready-to-use file below), or
- Create a lightweight `styles.css` and move styles out of the HTML, or
- Prepare the GitHub Pages configuration and instructions to publish this as a Project Site.
